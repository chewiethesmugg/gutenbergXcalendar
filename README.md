# GutenbergXCalendar
A simple web app that automatically creates events in your google calendar to motivate you to read books.

### How Does It Work?
- My app allows you to either get a specific book that you desire or it gets a random book for you from the Gutenberg online library. 
- Depending on the popularity of the book a new calendar event in your google calendar is created. 
- You'll either get 30 days, 21 days or 14 days to read a book. The more popular it is, the less time you get.  

#### How To Get It Running:
- Download all the files in this repo into a folder, name it what you wish.
- Then log into the google developer console and create a Google Calendar project. Make sure to save the credentials they give in the folder you used in the previous step.
- Replace all the information in the **<>** in the **credentials.json** with the credentials you received from the previous step. 
- The site is hosted on localhost:3000
